# Project 3: RADAR ASW Module Testing for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **RADAR ASW (Application Software) module testing** for **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**, specifically for the **Medium Range Radar (MRR)** system.  
The objective was to validate and enhance radar-based ACC functionalities, ensuring effective communication, diagnostics, and fault management for real-time vehicle operations.

### Roles & Responsibilities
- Analyzed requirements for RADAR MRR ASW modules, specifically for ACC functionalities.
- Designed and reviewed test cases to validate ACC performance and ensure compliance with standards.
- Executed test cases, identified defects, and managed the defect lifecycle (logging, tracking, and retesting).
- Performed fix testing and collaborated with developers for issue resolution.
- Ensured compliance with quality standards, improving RADAR ASW robustness in real-world conditions.
